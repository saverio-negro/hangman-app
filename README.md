  Do you have a way with words? Lo and behold, Hangman is one of the games that best suits your need for lexical challenges. ðŸ˜Ž <br>
  You haven't ever played Hangman before? What the he...Ehm, no worries! ðŸ˜‡
</p>

<p>
  The following Hangman game is quite simple, and since it was initially thought of as a mini-project on my end, it has no GUI (Graphical User Interface); in other words, it runs on the terminal.  
</p>

<p>
  The game entails guessing the word you are given. Each guess needs to be any letter in the English alphabet. You start out with 6 lives. If your guess is wrong, then you get detracted 1 life     from your remaining lives. In case you have already guessed a certain letter, you do not lose a life, and are asked to keep up by guessing another letter. When your guess is right, then the      guessed letter replaces any blank spaces where that letter is contained in the given word.
</p>

<p>
  Hangman App is written in Python and you can launch it either from any local IDE which is able to compile Python source code, or any other Python code editors/compilers from the web which 
  enables you to edit and run the code.
